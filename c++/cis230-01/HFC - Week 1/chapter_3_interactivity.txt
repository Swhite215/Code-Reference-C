Chapter 3 Expressions and Interactivity

    a. The cin Object - cin.cpp
    b. Mathematical Expressions - math_expressions.cpp
    c. Data Type Conversion and Type Casting - casting.cpp
        - Data Type Ranking
            - long double, double, float, unsigned long long int, long long int, unsigned long int, long int, unsigned int, int
        - Conversion Rules
            - Promoted - converted to a higher data type
            - Demoted - converted to a lower data type
            - Rule 1 - char, short, and unsigned short values are automatically promoted to int values
            - Rule 2 - when an operator works with two values of different data types, the lower-ranking value is promoted to the type of the higher ranking value
            - Rule 3 - when the final value of an expression is assigned to a variable, it will be converted to the data type of that variable
            - Imporatnt - if variable receiving the value is of a lower data type than the value, the value will be demoted to the type of the variable, and in some cases part of the value can be lost
    d. Overflow and Underflow - under_over_flow.cppw
    e. Named Constants - constants.cpp
    f. Multiple and Combined Assignment - multi_assignment.cpp
    g. Formatting Output - format_output.cpp
    h. Working with Characters and Strings - chars_strings.cpp
    i. More Mathematical Library Functions - math_library.cpp
    j. Random Numbers - random.cpp
