Chapter 9 Searching, Sorting, and Algorithm Analysis

    a. Linear Search - algorithms/linear_search.cpp
    b. Binary Search - algorithms/binary_search.cpp
        - Power of 2 is used to calculate the maximum number of comparisons the binary search will need to make on an array of any size
        - Simply find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than the number of elements in the array
        - Example - 50,000 elements, n must be 16, because 2^16 = 65,536
    c. Searching an Array of Objects
    d. The Bubble Sort - algorithms/bubble_sort.cpp
    e. A More Efficient Bubble Sort
    f. The Selection Sort - algorithms/selection_sort.cpp
    g. Sorting and Searching Vectors
    h. Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms
