Chapter 6 Notes

1. Array Essentials
    - Initialization
    - Looping through Arrays
    - Linear and Binary Search
    - Multidimensional Arrays
    - Arrays of Variable Length

2. Secure Programming
    - Do Bound's Checking for Array Indices
    - Use scanf_s, scanf does not prevent buffer overflows when reading a string into char array.
    - Don't Use Strings Read from User as Format-Control Strings

Extra:
    - Common Errors
        - Forgetting to initialize the elements of an array
        - Providing more intilizers in an array intializer list than there are elements in the array
        - Ending #define or #include with a semicolon
        - Assigning a value to a symbolic constant in an executable statement
        - C has no array bounds checking to prevent the program from referring to an eleemnt that does not exist
        - Assuming the elements of a local static array are intilized to zero every time the function is called
