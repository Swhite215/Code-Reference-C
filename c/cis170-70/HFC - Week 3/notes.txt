Chapter 4 Notes

1. Iteration Essentials
    - Counter Controlled - definite iteration = number of iterations known
    - Sentinel Controlled - indefinite iteration - number of iterations is unknown


Extra:
    - Common Errors
        - Off-by-one
        - Attempting to access control variable defined in for statement header
        - Using floating point values for iteration
        - Using commas instead of semi-colons in a for header
        - Changing the value of the control variable inside the body of a for loop
        - Using float or double to perform monetary calculations
        - Forgetting a break statement when one is needed in s switch statement
        - Using == for assignment or using = for equality
