Important Notes from Chapter 3: Structured Program Development in C

    1. Algorithms - procedure for solving a problem
        - actions to be executed
        - order in which the actions are executed
        - program control is ordering the statements to be executed
    2. Pseudocode
        - actions and decision statements
    3. Control Structures
        - sequential execution - statements executed one after another
        - transfer of control - specify the next statement to be executed may be other than the next one in sequence
        - goto statement - transfer control to one of many possible destinations in a program
        - sequence structure - execute C statements one after the other in the order in which they are written
        - selection structure
            - if, if...else, switch
        - iteration structure
            - while, do..while, and for
        - flowchart - graphical representation of an algorithm, or portion of an algorithm
            - flowlines - connect rectangles, diamonds, rounded rectangles and circles
            - first symbol is rounded rectangle symbol containing the word "Begin"
            - last symbol is rounded rectangle containing the word "End"
            - diamond symbol - decision symbol
    4. Formulating Algorithms
        - sentinel value (signal, dummy, or flag) - indicates end of entry, indefinite iteration because the number of iterations isn't known
        - top-down stepwise refinement
