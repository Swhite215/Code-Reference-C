Chapter 2 and Chapter 3: Secure C Programming

1. Avoid using single-argument printfs
    - To display a string that terminates with a newline, use the puts() function
        - puts("Hello World!")
    - To display a string without terminating a newline character, use printf with two arguments
        - printf("%s", "Hello World!");
2. Arithmetic Overflow
    - Adding integers could result in a value that is too large to store in an int variable
3. Unsigned Integers
    - counters that should store only non-negative values should be declared with unsigned before the integer type
4. scanf_s and printf_s
